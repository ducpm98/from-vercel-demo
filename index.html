            <p>My name is Duc Pham, I was born in Vietnam in 1998. I am currently a senior, majoring in
              <b>Computer Science at GVSU </b>. In retirement, my dad works as a housekeeper for my mom, he used
              to own a mini supermarket. My mother works for the Vietnamese government, she is also an
              agency of many different schools, colleges, and universities in America. Not only that, she is an
              investor, investing in stock, lands, and company brands.
            </p>
            <p>After spending a couple of years in the US, I get into learning and doing more computer-related
              things. That is when I decided to choose <b>Computer Science</b> as my major. While learning
              computer science I found it is not as easy as it looks. However, I was taught to be responsible for
              myself, as well as my choice, I managed to overcome the struggle I have while studying and
              found myself enjoying solving programming problems.</p>
            <p> As an international student, language
              differences can be a difficulty in pursuing my major, therefore, it always takes me a bit longer to
              understand the programming instructions and solve it. In the same way as my parents, I am
              hardworking and I won't give up until I archive something, which is something I am always
              proud of.</p>
